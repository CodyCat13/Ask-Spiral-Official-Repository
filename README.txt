# README for Ask Spiral #

This is the README file for the Ask Spiral app. When first using it, be sure to check out the "About" page to read about why Spiral exists and how she works!

The files in this folder contain everything you need to run my app:

* `applab/applab.js` - This file contains the applab library, which has all the
  javascript that applab uses to run the app.

* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling for the app.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that I designed in applab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  the app.

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in my
  app that I specified under the Design tab.

* `code.js` - This file has all the behavior code I wrote for the app.

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files that I uploaded in applab.

This project was made using Code.org. Have fun with the fortune teller!
